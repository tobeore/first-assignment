 <p>there is a saying that tiny droplets make a mighty ocean.
        have we ever asked ourselves what this means?
        <p>do we ever wonder how feasible it is for awater droplets to form a mighty ocean </p>
    </p>
    <p>i think this quote focuses on effort and patience. To achieve something
        great in future every one starts small and continually work on what he or she has started on but for one to achieve this
    he or she must also have patience rrto endure all setbacks and obstacles </p>
